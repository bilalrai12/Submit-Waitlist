## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Guide

### üìÇ Required Files

- `accounts.txt`: Your email list in the format: `email|password`
- `proxies.txt`: Proxy list in the format: `http://user:pass@ip:port`
- `main.py`: Main automation script
- `requirements.txt`: Python packages needed

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Adjust Number of Threads

Inside `main.py`, locate line **14**:

```python
threads = 10  # Config threads
```

You can increase or decrease this number depending on your system capability and proxy quality. 

üìå **Tip:** Too many threads with poor proxies can cause failures. Start with 10‚Äì20 and scale from there.

## üì¢ Notes

- Avoid using public proxies for better success rate.
